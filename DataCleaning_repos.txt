Got it! I’ll generate here the detailed Grand Plan Data Masterlist text with 100+ datasets covering all core domains (Geopolitics, Wars, Governments, Economy, Culture, Demographics, Climate), including accurate direct raw file URLs (CSV, GeoJSON, etc.) from public GitHub repos or official open-data sources, no portals, no downloads needed beyond raw HTTP GET.

How to use
* The GitHub raw URLs can be fetched directly by your Python bot using standard HTTP GET.

* Datasets with portal restrictions are marked — those will require extra steps or data requests.

* Many repos have multiple CSVs in data folders; browsing repo trees or GitHub API can list these files programmatically.

* For geospatial datasets, GeoJSON and shapefiles can be converted or used directly in Unity.

* Future projections mostly use SSP climate scenarios, UN WPP demographic models, and IMF/WEO economic forecasts.

If you want, I can also provide a formatted CSV or JSON manifest listing all these datasets, or a Python script to auto-fetch and validate each raw URL.

Do you want me to proceed with generating that manifest or code next?
